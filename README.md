# GeneticAlgorithm

## Outline for my projects
* Randomly initialize populations
* Determine finess of population
* Until convergence, repeat:
    * Select parents
    * Crossover and create new possibilities
    * Preform mutations
    * Calculate fitness

## Three Principals of Natural Selection
Heredity: Childreen recieve properties of parents
Variation: Variety of traits
Selection: Survival of the fittest


## Crossover
Taking a percentage of traits from both parents to create new offspring
Can be 50/50 or not, In the case of words, crossover would take letters from both parents and combine them
